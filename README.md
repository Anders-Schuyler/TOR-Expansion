# TOR-Expansion
Repository for my unofficial personal expansion for the M&amp;B2: Bannerlord mod The Old Realm mod. 
Currently the mod is "Dirty" meaning that it overwrites the base files in base The Old Realm (TOR) Mod. 
It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you backup the original files that will be overwritten by the files included in this repo.

File Currently Overwritten:
TOR_Core
  ->ModuleData
    ->tor_custom_xmls
      tor_extendeditemproperties.xml
      tor_extendedunitproperties.xml
    tor_equipment_sets.xml
    tor_partytemplates.xml
    tor_troopdefinitions.xml
TOR_Armory
  ->tor_items
    tor_meleeweapons.xml

Current Content:
Currently the Repo contains a modified Norscan and Warriors of Chaos Troop Tree.
+Norscan Horsemaster has a higher-Tier mount
+Added Norscan Huscarl upgrade from the Norscan Horsemaster.

Warrior of Chaos (Undivided) Troop Tree Revamp:
-Removes the chaos-god specific troops (Potential standalone troop trees in the future)
+Adds Chaos Warrior Greatweapon & Halberd upgrade options
+Adds Chaos Chosen Warrior: sword&shield, greatweapon, & halberd upgrade options from theior respective Chaos Warrior Unit.
  Chaos Chosen Warriors are unbreakable and their weapons also deal 10% of their damage as fire damage.

+Chaos "Sorcerer" Armor: duplicated current chaos armor with lower weight to not reduce Winds of Magic (WoM) Generation (Since Chaos Armor should not prevent WoM generation).

Chaos Dwarf Troop Trees:
+Chaos Dwarf Elite (Chaos Dwarfs) Troop Tree: Using only the asssets currently available in the base mod.
+Chaos Dwarf Basic (Hobgoblin) Troop Tree: Will be very limited in apperance due not having a goblin-eqsue skeleton currently in the base mod.
Chaos Dwarf Engineer troop tree to operate Empire artillery

Dwarfven Mountain Holds Troop Trees:
The barebones Dwarfven Mountain Holds Troop Tree (Basic, Elite, Slayer, Engineer) had been added.
I still need to add the equipment sets for the troops.

Future (Potential) Content:
Dependent on further investigation into the Base Mod coding:
1. Warriors of Chaos Wanderers (Exalted Hero (Melee) & Chaos Sorcerer (Fire & Metal)
2. Chaos Dwarf Wanderers (Castellan & Daemonsmith(Fire & Metal)
3. Chaos Dwarf Culture & Clan
4. Chaos Dwarf Bull Centaur (Cavalry) troop tree.
